# Jarrett's Boilerplate

A special boilerplate just for me. This makes projects easier to start and covers some basic issues in cross browser compatibility.

## Notes:

- Based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
- Includes [SCSS for foundation framework](http://www.initializr.com/)
- Updated directory structure so assets are contained in the assets directory.

## How to use this:

1. On the main repository page, click the 'download ZIP' button to get a ZIP file of the Boilerplate.
2. Rename the downloaded ZIP file to the name of the new project you want to start with the Boilerplate - this will be the project root directory.
3. Move the project root directory from your downloads directory to where you keep your projects.
4. Place the main.scss file into a pre-processor to compile.
5. Start your work on your new project.
